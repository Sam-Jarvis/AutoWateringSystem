### This repository contains 3D designs, code and a technical report of an automatic plant watering system I built.<br>

The system is designed and built to be run on an arduino, thus it is programmed in C using the Arduino IDE. The purpose of the system is to water herbs or other plants without human interaction. This is based on a timer that can be set by the user. The system can water a set number of plants or it can adapt to the number of plants on the fly given that an ultrasonic sensor is connected.<br>

The parts necessary to build the system are:
* Servo (small)
* Arduino
* Jumper wires
* Ultrasonic sensor _opt_
* 9V battery
* Relay
* Aquarium pump
